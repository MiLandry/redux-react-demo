# redux-demo

## the facts
its not going to use express, I don"t want to set up views
Its going to use webpack-dev-server
Webpack-dev-server just serves all the files statically. browser just hits machine root, that serves index.html, which bootstraps to bundle.js


## getting started
build the project
`npm i`
then
`npm start`

then browse to
http://localhost:8080/

Note that live reload is available
